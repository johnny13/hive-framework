"Demo":http://testing3.designhive.com/.

A website development framework built with Sass and Compass, and incorporating jQuery UI. The theme styling is intentionally minimal to make re-skinning easier.

Source image files (Adobe Illustrator .ai and Adobe Photoshop .psd formats) are also included, within the @/src/assets/img/@ directory.

h2. Minimum browser support

* Apple Safari 5+
* Google Chrome 30+
* Microsoft Internet Explorer 8+
* Mozilla Firefox 24+
* Opera Browser 12+

Older versions of the above and other browsers may work, but these are the ones we verify.

h2. Requirements

Building this repository requires:

* "Node.js":http://nodejs.org/ >=0.10.0
* "Ruby":http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/
* "Bundler":http://bundler.io/
* "Grunt":http://gruntjs.com/ ~0.4.0
* "Bower":http://bower.io/ >=1.0.0

h2. Setup

h3. Installing required tools

The project uses "Grunt":http://gruntjs.com/ to run tasks and "Sass":http://sass-lang.com/ for CSS pre-processing. First make sure you have base dependencies installed: "Ruby":http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/, "Node.js":http://nodejs.org/, "Bundler":http://bundler.io/, "Grunt":http://gruntjs.com/ and "Bower":http://bower.io/. You can install Node and Ruby using their installers, Bundler with gem and the rest with npm:

bc. $ gem install bundler
$ npm install -g bower grunt-cli

Consult the tools' documentation for more instructions. You might need to use @sudo npm install -g bower grunt-cli@ instead when installing on certain Unix-based systems.

h3. Installing dependencies

After you have the base dependencies taken care of, you can install the project's dependencies. Navigate to the project's directory, and run the dependency managers:

bc. $ cd hive-framework
$ npm install
$ bundle install
$ bower install

*npm* installs Node modules for Grunt, *bundle* takes care of Ruby gems, and *bower* manages client-side scripts. You might need to use @sudo npm install@ instead when installing on certain Unix-based systems.

h2. Building

This repository hosts sources and needs to be built before it can be used. After you have installed all dependencies, you will be able to run tasks using Grunt, including building:

bc. $ grunt [task]

Where the @[task]@ is either @build@, @criticalcss@, @test@ or @watch@.

* The @build@ task builds the project.
* The @criticalcss@ task analyses a page of your website and provides an example file of CSS rules that it deduces are critical to rendering 'above-the-fold content'. This can be helpful in improving page rendering performance and speed test results (e.g., "Google PageSpeed Insights":https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/).
* The @test@ task runs JSHint over your JavaScript files, checking the code quality.
* The @watch@ task will launch a task that watches for file changes; the project is then automatically built if a source file is modified.

h2. Textpattern templates

Optional "Textpattern CMS":http://textpattern.com theme 'forms' and 'pages' templates are included, for reference. They can be found in the @public/templates@ directory, and follow the structure expected by the "rah_flat":https://github.com/gocom/rah_flat Textpattern plugin.
